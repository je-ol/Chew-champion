## **About The Project**

![](https://i.imgur.com/d1Pdd7X.png)

Chew champion is a full stack project aimed to be a space where you can share content related to competitive eating and connect with like minded people. You can register, login, have your own profile and create new posts which other members can read and interact with. You can like your favorite posts and leave a comment. 

The main page features a grid structure where you can see the latest posts, but you can also visit the list section where you can browse through every single post in an infinite scroll. If there is a specific type of post you want to look for, you can use the search on the navbar. 

## Build With:
This is my first project using Vue on the front end along with Pinia for state management. Other technologies used:
